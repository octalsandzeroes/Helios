              <h2 class="title">The Problem: Orbital Debris</h2>
              <p>
                As the space industry continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, the accumulation of space debris has become a significant threat to both current and future missions. Thousands of defunct satellites, spent rocket stages, and fragments from collisions clutter Earth's orbit, posing severe risks to operational satellites, space stations, and manned missions. This debris not only endangers the infrastructure essential for modern life, such as GPS and communication satellites, but also increases the likelihood of catastrophic collisions, creating more debris in a dangerous feedback loop known as the Kessler Syndrome. Moreover, some studies suggest that debris in higher orbits could negatively impact Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, adding an environmental dimension to this already critical issue.

              <h2 class="title">The Solution: ASTRAEA</h2>
              <p>
                Helios has developed the ASTRAEA (Advanced Satellite for Tracking, Recovery, And Eradication of Aggregate) to tackle this pressing problem head-on. ASTRAEA employs a dual-method approach, utilizing electromagnets to attract or repel metallic debris and specialized nets to capture non-magnetic junk. Once captured, the debris can be safely deorbited to burn up in Earth's atmosphere or stored for later disposal. This innovative satellite system provides a proactive and efficient solution to mitigate the risks posed by space debris, ensuring the continued safety and sustainability of orbital operations. By partnering with major space agencies like NASA, Helios aims to protect and maintain the vital space infrastructure upon which our modern world relies, paving the way for future exploration and technological advancement.
